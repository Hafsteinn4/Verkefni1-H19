                   <strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
                            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
                            text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
                            of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
                            survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
                            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
                            the 1960s with the release of the Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>
                            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
                            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br>

                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the  <br>
                            readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  <br>
                            using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution  <br>
                            of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',  <br>
                            making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing  <br>
                            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their  <br>
                            default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover  <br>
                            many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved  <br>
                            over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose  <br>
                            (injected humour and the like). <br>
